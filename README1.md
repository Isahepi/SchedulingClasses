# Scheduling Classes App
### 1.✅ Project Introduction (1 or 2 paragraphs)
__What does your app do?__
This app is designed to identify and display scheduling conflicts among students in the CS386 class (excluding current seniors). The main goal is to visually represent when students' classes overlap, helping users understand which time slots are already occupied. By doing this, the app can assist professors or the registrar's office in finding potential time windows where a new class could be added, without yet considering room or instructor availability.
__Who is the target user?__
The primary users of this app are professors and the registrar’s office, as it supports academic planning. However, the app also includes a feature for students to input the classes they’ve already taken, allowing the system to simulate real-time schedules. This way, users can see a complete view of everyone’s availability and conflicts in one place.
### 2.✅ Design and Architecture

Description of how the app is structured.
Include Mermaid class diagrams for all classes.

# Database Model
```mermaid

    class MyApp {
        +build()
    }

    class MyHomePage {
        +title: String
        +createState(): State
    }

    class _MyHomePageState {
        -userName: String
        -selectedMajor: String?
        -majors: List<String>
        -studentNames: List<String>
        -selectedName: String?
        -classList: List<Map>
        -takenClasses: Map<String, bool>
        +initState()
        +loadMajors()
        +loadStudentNames()
        +loadClassesForMajor(major: String)
        +build()
    }

    class SchedulePage {
        +userName: String
        +createState(): State
    }

    class _SchedulePageState {
        -selectedNames: List<String>
        -studentSchedules: Map<String, Map<String, List<String>>>
        +initState()
        +fetchSchedule()
        +generateTimes(): List<String>
        +getScheduleColor(name: String): Color
        +build()
    }

    class API {
        <<interface>>
        +GET /api/major
        +GET /api/students
        +GET /api/classes
        +GET /api/schedule
    }

   %% Database Tables
    class Students {
        <<table>>
        +id: int
        +name: String
        +year_id: int
    }

    class Majors {
        <<table>>
        +id: int
        +major_name: String
    }

    class Classes {
        <<table>>
        +id: int
        +class_name: String
        +major_id: int
    }

    class Schedule {
        <<table>>
        +id: int
        +student_id: int
        +day: String
        +schedules: String
    }

    %% App Relationships
    MyApp --> MyHomePage
    MyHomePage --> _MyHomePageState
    SchedulePage --> _SchedulePageState

    _MyHomePageState --> API : calls
    _SchedulePageState --> API : calls
    API --> Students : queries
    API --> Majors : queries
    API --> Classes : queries
    API --> Schedule : queries
